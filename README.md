# Cycle_Renting

We tried to create a web application which functions on reducing gap between customer and service providers.
This application has features like recommender system that eases the consumer's process of finding the most appropriate cycle for any purpose.

Problem Statement
In places such as college campuses, the students not owning a cycle often face the problem of cycle unavailability/shortage at the time of requirement. Also, it is difficult for most of the students to buy a bicycle for their regular movement. It is also often difficult to know who has got a spare bicycle.

Solution
To resolve this problem and bridge the gap between the renters and rentees, a system(website) is required where students or even the official body can rent out bicycles, and students can have access to them whenever needed, with immediate effect.
The renters and rentees will be registered and will have a profile set up for themselves. When somebody will need a bicycle, they can set a public request on their profile to rent a cycle and can also send specific requests to people who are renting bicycles. Any person who is up for renting will be providing his cost on an hourly basis. The person can also choose when he/she will be available for renting out cycles, and this will be displayed on their profile.
